<p> Hello! This is my comp sci 1 journal. It is also my birthday and first day of highschool. I am looking forward to learning more about how computer science works this year. </p>

<p> 9/16/19 </p>

<p> In comp sci this week, we have been doing a lot of work on these things called person cards. Person cards essentially function as divs. When person cards are hovered over, they can play music, dance, and change colors/imagery. I've been trying to work with mine, however I have encountered some difficulties. Hopefully i'll be able to figure it out before curriculum night, when the cards are presented. </p>

<p> 9/23/19 </p>
<p> Greetings! My person card is bad in my opinion. It is small, and it is rigid. I personally really do not like how it turned out, however I can always find a way to include it in future projects to try and improve my skills. </p>

<p> 9/30/19 </p>
<p> Hi! Today we do not have comp sci. We have been doing a lot of work with divs, particularly how to make them move. I like how we are delving beneath the surface of html and css, and working towards incorporating more complex elements into our websites </p>

<p> 10/3/19 </p>
<p> Our teacher has began to suggest the idea of a project that we work on throughout the year that will be entirely based on our individual passions and desires. I am exited, however at the same time I have no idea what I want to do. I suppose i'll figure it out sooner or later. </p>


<p> 10/10/19</p>

	<p> Our comp sci teacher has put an emphasis on passion in our class. Particularly, she wants us to work on things we are truly passionate about, rather than assigning us strict projects that heavily impact our grades. My hobbies include figure skating, drawing, and reading. I am also interested in government and politics and I love thai food. I want to find ways to incorporate this into my project. </p>
<p> 10/17/19 </p>
<p> Hello! We have had a bunch of days off from comp sci, as we have had holidays that often fall on mondays or fridays, both days that we have comp sci. Our teacher wants us to think about projects that we can utilize to build upon our knowledge in comp sci, while also working on a passion that we love. I am not really sure what to do yet, but i'll update you when I decide. </p>

<p> 10/24/19 </p>

<p> Hello Again! This journal entry is about the introduction of my coding project. My project is a mirror that you can look in, and you have the option to wear what you desire. In the menu, i will eventually make a link to the site with my project. Until then, enjoy your life. </p>

<a href="https://jaswynn.github.io/room.html"> <p> the magnificent room!!! </p>  </a>

<p> 10/31/19 </p>
<p> Today I had a pivotal lab with my comp sci teacher. To be honest - I hadn't really been enjoying the class. I was doing things more because I had to rather than I want to - as signing up for this class was not my personal choice. Rather, I have had to search for ways to accomodate my situation, which my computer science teacher fully understood. So together we decided that I would not do the mirror project, but rather I would take a chance to regrou and decide what I <i> really </i> want to do, as this will be something that is entirely my choice. </p>

<p> 11/6/19 </p>
<p> Hi! I have pondering about what I like to do in computer science, and how I can translate my interests into an immensely enjoyable project. What I like to do is code various small websites using html and css - I prefer to keep it simple. Simplicity is what I gravitate towards, however I know my project will have to build upon some of the skills that we are learning in class - namely Java. I will continue to ponder about my project, but until then we'll wait and see. </p>

<p> 11/13/19 </p>
<p> I Decided to uproot my original project idea and I decided instead to make a figure skating project that involves html and css. I am an avid figure skater, as I wake up at 4:00 am some days to go skate. It is something I am truly passionate about - and through this project I can bring my passion to comp sci 1. Essentially, it functions as a website that has every single figure skating move that are mandatory basic skills, and linked to each skill will be a video of me performing the skill. I am psyched to show you the end result! </p> 
<p> 11/22/19 </p>

<p> Hi! It has been a while since I submitted my last journal entry. Since then, I have made progress with my figure skating websites. I decided to create a website of me completing every single move required to complete Basics 1-6 and Freeskate 1-6. I am looking forward to linking the completed project. This latest entry is to inform you of ideas I have concerning the use of javascript in websites. I was thinking about a website that has div with roygbiv written in the center. When one clicks on any one of the roygbiv letters, the background of the website will change to the color selected. Attached below is my sketch of the idea </p>

<p> Hello Again! Today I am writing to inform you guys of a nice, short webpage that informs people about the language of Javascript! It aids in the debunking of several myths and fears held towards computer science, and it also includes several cute kittens. It explains how javascript works in a very straighforward way, and it has encouraged me to try to start utilizing javascript functions in my coding too. Enjoy! </p>

<p> Hi! Below is the project that I have been working on for computer science 1. Essentially, it is a compilation of me figure skating. </p>

<p> Hello! We have been doing a lot of javascript projects, particularly how to make a function. I have always wanted to learn javascript, so I am very interested in what we are doing. Particularly, we are learning how to make arrays in javascript. Below is a codesketch for the array I could make for our Fizzbuzz project. </p>

<p>12/19/19</p>
<p> Hello and <b> Happy Holidays! </b> </p>
<p> This week, we have been assigned to make presents for someone that we deem important in our respective lives. I decided to make a webpage for my friend Leo. The div with the porcupine is supposed to bounce and play music when hovered upon. The music that is playing is the Saint Paul's Suite, which is a piece that we played for orchestra. He also loves small animals, which is why there is a baby porcupine. Additionally, I have been making slow progress with my figure skating project, as I need to edit more of my videos so that I can post them. I have also come across some problems with putting the images online, so I will continue to work on that. Below are the links to some of my experiments with javascript. I am well aware that some of them do not work, but I will have to meet with my computer science teacher after break to discuss further.</p>

<p> 2/3/2020 </p>

<p> First post of the new decade! 2020 has honestly been a terrible year so far. In comp sci, I have attempted a lot but not done more to dig deeper into the assignment. Therefore, this week I will go to a lab with molly and improve a lot of my javascript. </p>

<p> 2/4/2020 </p>

<p> Today I met with Molly about how to create websites utilzing javascript, as this is something that I have been having a lot of trouble with. During our meeting, I was able to recode the <a href ="https://jaswynn.github.io/dumplings.htm"> dumpling array </a> so that it could function properly. We utilized javascript to create an array function which would repeat the image of dumplings on a plate every couple of seconds.</p> 

<p> 2/5/2020 </p>

<p> Today I tried to code a function that would have a bunch of divs appear in random positions on a screen at any given time. I utilized various websites to hopefully get some guidence. However, this did not go so well. While I did learn the mechanics of making a javascript function, I ultimately did not end up accomplishing my main goal. Tomorrow I will meet with Molly so that I can hopefully go over everything. </p> 


<p> 2/6/2020 </p>

<p> Today I was able to finally code the random div website! I was so pleased about how it went, as javascript is something that I have been struggling with this entire semester. It has always been something that i've wanted to learn, and I am glad that I have had this opportunity. Belhold, <a href ="https://jaswynn.github.io/pastel.html"> the link to the final result :) </a> </p> 

<p> 2/21/2020 </p>

<p> Hello! Recently in Comp Sci, we have been working on our semester 2 projects. Our teacher had a website where she displayed her thoughts about different kinds of animals products. She wanted us to come up with something similar for ourselves. So, I thought about creating a webpage with a subway bullet in the center, and below it having a story of a time on that train. From there, our teacher suggested that I collaborate with another student who was also interested in trains. And now, we have a podcast about the NYC subway system. Next week, I will link to the website, and hopefully we will post our first episode by then. </p>

<p> 3/4/2020 </p>
<p> Greetings!  Since my last entry, I have been working on a podcast about the NYC Subway with Dagmar (another CS1 student). Dagmar and I both like taking the subway for <i> fun </i> (shocking!), so we have decided to make a podcast together. The podcast is called <a href="https://jaswynn.github.io/the%20_train.html"> "The Train." </a> We have recorded around 3 episodes -- none of them are posted yet. Dagmar and I are learning about posting and editing voice recordings. Once we have learned, we will organize the episodes by subway story. </p>

<p> Hello! I haven't journalled a lot in the last month, due to the rapid changes going in my school & home life due to none other than COVID-19 (😒). This has been especially difficult, considering I live in NYC. Our assignment for today was to design a piece of "adversarial fashion," which basically means a garment/accessory that will protect your identity from cameras & identification systems, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once). Below is my image: </p>
 <img src="https://github.com/JasWynn/JasWynn.github.io/blob/master/videos/IMG_1810.jpg?raw=true"> </img>

<p> The idea is that it is a visor that contains technology to make your face invisible to camera processing systems. The visor can come in any design, as long as it's not transparent. I feel that our society should do a better job of protecting the privacy of civilians, as privacy is a basic universal human right. </p>

<p> Hi again! So in my last post I discussed the Quarantine in NYC briefly. Attached is a codesketch that represents my freedom over these last few weeks. Images that lead to "no" represent the things I can no longer do, while images that lead to "yes" represent what I have been doing during quarantine. Stay safe. </p>

<p> Hello! I just met with my comp sci instructor to discuss arrays. I previous entry that I have made was inaccurate concerning my code. Therefore we went over it togther in order to improve my code. Below is a list of steps I made in order to create my array. </p>
<li>
	<ol> Made an Element </ol>
	<ol> Created list of objects within the element </ol>
	<ol> Make another div with the variable/Element of spice within it </ol>
	<ol> Add another element that increases the length/numerical value of the element inside the div </ol>

</li>

<p> Happy May! I have a hard time believing that the school year has gone by so fast! Just this week, we registered for new classes. In computer science this week, we decided to discuss the topic of machine learning. Essentially, this concerns how before AI is able to do AI type things, it must taught how to behave in an "intelligent" manner. However, the article also drew attention to how AI is replacing human jobs -- a very important issue. My personal insights into AI is that we should be more responsible as a human race to ensure that the AI we develop will be able to sustain the livlihoods of the human race in future genrations, rather than just throwing it all away for the benefit of a few. Therefore, I believe that humans should slow down the development of certain AI technology. </p>

<p> 5/11/2020 </p>

<p> I hope your quarantine is going well! Apparently NYC will begin to reopen next month, but we'll see. Yesterday was mother's day, and I tried making my mom a <a href="https://jaswynn.github.io/mommyauntgrandma.html">virtual card. </a> It didn't go so well but I am going to ask my computer science teacher for some help later this week. </p>
