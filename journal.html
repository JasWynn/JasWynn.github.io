<p> Hello Again! It is your girl back at it again. This journal entry is about the introduction of my coding space project. My project is a mirror that you can look in, and you have the option to wear what you desire. In the menu, i will eventually make a link to the site with my project. Until then, enjoy your life. </p>

<p> Hi! It has been a while since I submitted my last journal entry. Since then, I have made progress with my figure skating websites. I decided to create a website of me completing every single move required to complete Basics 1-6 and Freeskate 1-6. I am looking forward to linking the completed project. This latest entry is to inform you of ideas I have concerning the use of javascript in websites. I was thinking about a website that has div with roygbiv written in the center. When one clicks on any one of the roygbiv letters, the background of the website will change to the color selected. Attached below is my sketch of the idea </p>
